An object is, conceptually, a self-contained unit consisting of 
Attributes(data) and procedures(functions)
Attributes
Procedures
Data

Encapsulation refers to
Combining data and code into a single object 
Storing data into an object
Creating functions for an object
Protecting data

Data hiding refers to an objectâ€™s ability to
Hide its data from code that is outside the object 
Hide its data from code that is inside the object 
Hide its data
Hide its procedures

A class is not an object, but it is
A description of an object
An instance of an object
Code that specifies the attributes that a particular type of object may have 
Code that specifies the functions that a particular type of object may have

An object is not a class, but it is
An instance of a class
A description of a class
Code that specifies the attributes that a class may have 
Code that specifies the functions that a class may have

Which of the following is true about class constructors?
A default constructor is a constructor that takes no parameters
A class cannot have more than one constructors
Constructors may have different names as their class
Constructors are not necessary for classes

Which of the following is true about classes?
By default all members of a class are set to private
By default all members of a class are set to public
By default all members of a class are set to protected
None of these are true

For classes, which order must public and private members be declared?
The order does not matter, but by convention public members are declared before private members
Private members must be declared before public members
Public members must be declared before private members
They do not be need to declared at all 

Which method is correct when defining const member functions?
double getWidth() const;
const double getWidth();
double const getWidth();
double getWidth(const);

What is the difference between structs and classes?
Classes by default set their members to private while for structs they are public
Classes by default set their members to public while for structs they are private
Classes can have member functions while structs may not
There is no difference and is dependent on programmer's preference

For a public setWidth function that takes in a double and returns nothing, which is the correct UML notation?
+ setWidth(w : double) : void
- setWidth(double : w) : void
+ setWidth(w : double) : double
- setWidth(double : w) : void

For a UML Class diagram, what are the three sections?
Class name, Member variables, Member functions
Default Constructor, User-Defined Constructor, Destructor
Private variables, Public Variables, Protected Variables
Function name, Data type, Function Parameter

Which of the following is an definition of an instance of a class?
Rectangle r;
Rectangle(int width, int length) {};
~Rectangle();
Rectangle::Rectangle() {};

Which of the following is an accessor function?
int getWidth() {return width;}
void setLength(int l) {length = l;}
Rectangle() {width = 10; length = 10;}
~Rectangle() {}
